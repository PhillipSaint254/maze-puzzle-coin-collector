1. Do these approaches have the same answers? How would you test this? What types of edge cases did you consider?
  - Yes they have the same answers
  - I tested it by first trying if the answers are same for all combinations that could be entered, then all test values entered using an input statement
  - I consider the furthest points from the end point, the point that had no way to the end point, and another point that is quite near the endpoint
  - Here is the screenshot of the executions
